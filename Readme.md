# Warm Reception

Warm Reception is a minimod for GZDoom that alters enemy behavior on level start.

With this mod, you can either make your life harder by aggravating every enemy
from the start, or effectively disable hot starts.

## Options

- Wake every enemy on a level (optionally even enemies in ambush), or
- Don't change original behavior, or
- Turn away enemies that look at you at level start, or
- Turn enemies to you at level start.
